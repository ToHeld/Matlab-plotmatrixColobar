# Matlab-plotmatrixColobar
Create a plotmatrix style figure with colored scatteplot. Give a Table with variable names as x/ylabels. The last column entry in the table is the used for the colorbar

This Version works the way I need it. I see many ways that could make it more usefull for other cases.
